Yes, that's me. On Time. And yes, it is a 100% fake. You can add yourself to one of many magazine covers at this <a href="http://www.funonit.com/funny_jokes/fake_magazine/">site</a>.

Oh - and I found this via <a href="http://www.dzone.com">DZone.com</a>, a darn nice Digg clone that focuses just on developer issues. I know that fake magazine covers don't really apply, but normally the site is pretty darn good. I definitely recommend it.
