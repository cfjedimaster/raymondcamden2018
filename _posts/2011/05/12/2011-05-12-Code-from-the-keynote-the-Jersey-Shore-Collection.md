Below you will attached the code from my "Jersey Shore" collection of CFBuilder, including:

<ul>
<li>The Charlie Sheen Motivational Dialog
<li>The Code Improver tool (fixes all bugs, security issues, and speed problems)
<li>SailorProof - removes cuss words from your code
<li>Artificial Code Assist - a living breathing (kinda) virtual assistant to help you write code
</ul>
