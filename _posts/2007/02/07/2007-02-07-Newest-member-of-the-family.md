Today my wife surprised me with an early birthday present - a new dog. Phyllis (yes, thats her name), is a Golden Retriever puppy that is 9 weeks old. I'm a sucker for dogs and now we have 2 (along with 5 cats that live outside). 

For fun - I'll send a ColdFusion coffee mug from <a href="http://coldfusiongear.com/cfgear/index.cfm">ColdFusionGear</a> to the first person who can tell me where I got the name Phyllis from.
