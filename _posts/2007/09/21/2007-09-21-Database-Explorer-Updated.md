Ben Forta sent in some nice updates to the <a href="http://cfdbexplorer.riaforge.org/">ColdFusion Database Explorer</a>. I've added these to the download. The new features include the ability to hide views (which really helps on SQL Server) and metadata about query results, as seen below:

Click on the image above for a larger version. Query result data is show for all queries now. In cases where data is returned, tabs are used. In the screen shot, you can see a delete example and how it now tells you how many rows were affected, which is pretty cool.
