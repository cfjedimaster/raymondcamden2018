Well, not this weekend. This lego set of an Imperial Star Destroyer was sent me to almost a year ago. But I finally finished it this week. It contains close to 1400 pieces, and believe it or not is the "small" Star Destroyer. My brother-in-law has the 3k one and it dwarfs mine. See more pictures here:

Slide 4 shows you a good comparison shot. In general the ship wasn't too hard to build, but at times got very fragile. In fact, when I carried it upstairs a piece fell of the bottom. After a year of building I decided to simply pretend it didn't happen and just hid the piece. I'm sure plenty of contractors do that - right?
