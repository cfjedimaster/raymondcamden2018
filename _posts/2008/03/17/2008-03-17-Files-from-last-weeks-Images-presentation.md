Unfortunately I never got around to zipping up my files from my presentation last week. I had a copy on my laptop (I'm traveling now) and while it's a bit old, in general it should be very close to what I demonstrated. I removed all the original images though to help keep the zip file size down, so you will need to replace the images used in the original code.

Sorry again for the delay!<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fimages%20copy%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
